It scans log files for specific patterns, such as error messages or suspicious activities, and generates alerts when such patterns are detected.


##Features
 - Parses log files to detect predefined suspicious patterns.
 - Generates alerts when patterns like "failed login," "unauthorized access," or "malicious activity detected" are    found.
 - Outputs alerts with timestamps for quick review.
 - Easy-to-use system for analyzing security logs.
